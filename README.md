# Python Sorting
This repo contains 3 sorting algorithms:

# Bubble Sorting:

Bubble sorting works by moving through a list of values, and for each value, if it is bigger than the value in front of it, it swaps the 2 values. It goes through the list n-1 times (meaning for each value in the list, it goes through the whole list, except for the last value as it has no value after it to swap with). The benefits of this algorithm is that it is easy to understand but it can take longer than other more optimised algorithms. It is very efficient for small lists.

# Selection Sort:

Selection sort works by finding the smallest value in a list, and moving it to the front of the list, or a new list altogether. This process is repeated n-1 times until all values have been accounted for. Similar to bubble sorting, this algorithm is very easy to understand and is far more optimised than bubble sorting.

# Insertion Sort:

Insertion sort is similar to bubble sort, it works by moving a value backwards on a list until it reaches a value that is smaller than it. This is a far more optimised version of bubble sorting as it only has to run through the list once, but it can take longer for each value. It is also a bit more challenging to code but not too difficult.

no extra libraries are needed besides matplotlib and pytest (if you want to test it). the only other libraries being used are random and time which are built in
